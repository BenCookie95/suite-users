# Tech Spec: Top Boards, My Top Boards

## Components 

1. Board icon
    * What do we show if it's empty? Boards don't have an icon by default so it could be the most common case.
1. Board name
    * Do we show the channel name if the board name is blank?
1. Count of cards added
    * Just cards added? Other resources that can be created and updated include:
        * [ ] view
        * [ ] text
        * [ ] comment
        * [ ] image
    * Just creates, no updates?
1. Avatars of participants
    * What constitues a "participant"? Anyone who has created or updated any resource in the board during the time range?
1. My boards
    * What makes a board "mine"? Boards I am the creator of or boards I participated in any way (create or update in the time range)?
